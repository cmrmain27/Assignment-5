# Assignment-5
This Assignment is the same as Assignment 4, however it is designed using Binary Search Trees instead of using LinkedLists. 
The purpose of this assignment is to show how efficent Binary Search Trees can be for solving real world problems. 

This program is designed to read in a dictionary as a Binary Search  tree according the first letters of each word, 
read in a file, check to see if each word in the file is found in the dictionary, and increments counters depending 
on words found, words not found, comparisons found, and comparisons not found. This program applies the use of 
Binary Search Trees to a real world problem and shows the difference in efficiency compared to using a Linked List 
to solve this real world problem.
